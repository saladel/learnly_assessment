## Task Description

Create a simple e-commerce product listing and detail page using Flutter. The application should fetch product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com)

### Requirements:

### Product Listing Page:

- Fetch a list of products from the provided API.
- Display the product name, image, and price in a grid or list view.
- Implement basic navigation to the Product Detail Page when a product is tapped.

### Product Detail Page:

- Display detailed information about the selected product, including name, image, price, and description.
- Include an "Add to Cart" button (functionality can be a no-op, just show a snackbar or toast message saying "Added to Cart").

### Styling and UI:

- Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.
- Use appropriate Flutter widgets and follow best practices for UI design.

### Code Quality:

- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- Use proper state management techniques (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, etc.).
